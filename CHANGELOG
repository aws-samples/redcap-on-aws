## v1.0.2

## v1.0.1

- Add support to deploy REDCap instances in `Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate` as an alternative to AWS App Runner. This is for users that require REDCap to execute user request that are longer than 120 seconds.

### Upgrade procedure to v1.0.1

This **ONLY** applies if you have deployed any previous version and you are using the automatically created AWS App Runner Custom Link Domain. e.g you have deployed with the stage settings `hostInRoute53: true,` and  `domain: '<your_redcap_domain>'` and you access your REDCap installation with your own domain name.

In this case, this project will have deployed an `A Record` in your Route 53 Hosted Zone that needs to be replaced and managed by CDK. The procedure is the following:

1. Run `yarn install` to install package updates.
2. In you `stages.ts` file, comment or delete your `domain: <your_redcap_domain>` and enter a different email/value for `email: <your_email>`
3. Deploy the v1.0.1 release
4. Revert the `stages.ts` changes (add your domain and previous email)
5. Deploy again to complete the changes

**Important:** These steps will cause disruption in your linked custom domain and new email notifications.

## v1.0.0

- Add new stack that deploys a temporary EC2 instance for large REDCap requests / workloads.
- Refactor IAM auth for RDS on CDK.
- Database authentication uses IAM as default.
- Docker image now will pull all the secrets for the application at container start.
- Add WAF rule allow for `NoUserAgent_HEADER` for `/survey` check.
- `redcapConfig.sql` will not be re-executed on new instances spawn or re-deployments. This is to avoid post deployment configurations reset.

### Breaking changes

- Aurora Serverless deployment V1 for `dev` stages is now replaced with Aurora Serverless V2. This is ONLY for `dev` stages, e.g `yarn dev --stage your_stage`. Do a full database backup and restore the data in the new instance if required.

### Upgrade procedure to v1.0.0

1. Create a database backup to prevent data loss if needed.

2. Run `yarn install` to install package updates.

3. In your AWS console, go to AWS App Runner and select your application. Navigate to the Configuration tab and change Deployment settings to `Manual`. Wait until the change takes effect. This change will be automatically reverted after this update is completed.

4. For your stage configuration in `stages.ts`, add the following parameter `deployTag: 'upgrade-v010'`. You can use other tag value if you wish.

5. Run `yarn deploy --stage <your_stage>`

6. Remove the added configuration paramter `deployTag` from stages.ts.
